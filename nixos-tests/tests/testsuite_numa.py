        provide a domain configuration with a different numa pinning along with
        it. If it is not provided, we expect the migration to fail gracefully.
        This means, that while we expect an error, we also expect no further
        effects on the runtime, e.g. we can still migrate afterwards and none of
        the services crashes.
